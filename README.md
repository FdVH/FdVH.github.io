# Theses

My academic theses from master's degrees in physics at Imperial College London and Weizmann Institute of Science are available here:
- "[In search for new resonances and lepton flavor violation at the LHC](https://fdvh.github.io/theses/Federico%20De%20Vito%20Halevy%20-%20In%20search%20for%20new%20resonances%20and%20lepton%20flavor%20violation%20at%20the%20LHC.pdf)" (Wiezmann, 2022)
- "[Percolation processes during the Epoch of Reionization and preceding cosmic phases](https://fdvh.github.io/theses/Federico%20De%20Vito%20Halevy%20-%20Percolation%20processes%20during%20the%20Epoch%20of%20Reionization%20and%20preceding%20cosmic%20phases.pdf)" (Imperial, 2018)
